Description:
Some aspects of making web content accessible are clear and simple, and some are less so. For example, you know the alt attribute is required, but what are the subtleties in writing the alternative content for images. Collaboration throughout the web development process is key. I will highlight where certain steps in the process need a collaborative approach and demonstrate with real examples how web content can be optimized for accessibility.

Learning Objectives:
Explain how, in the context of an online education environment, collaboration is key to an accessible web development process. Learn several techniques to make web content accessible.
